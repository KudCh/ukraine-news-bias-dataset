Here we will publish work we did to employ the Faerber2020Bias dataset for a comparison study of the use of different score aggregation techniques. 

The dataset empoys three score calculation modes: majority vote, average vote and intesified vote. We intend to compare the results of training a machine learning model given each of the score aggregations.
